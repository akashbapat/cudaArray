CudaArray (CUA) is a header-only library that simplifies creation, access, and
modification for 2D and 3D CUDA array-type objects, including linear-memory
arrays, texture objects, and surface objects.

Contributions are welcome for this project, especially since I don't have a lot
of time to devote to it. (To name a few TODO items, 3D texture arrays are not
yet implemented, texture mipmapping could be added, the random state array
implementation needs to be updated, and a multitude of tests and examples need
to be added.)
