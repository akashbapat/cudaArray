libcua (Library for CUDA Arrays) is a header-only library that simplifies
creation, access, and modification for 2D and 3D CUDA array-type objects,
including linear-memory arrays, texture objects, and surface objects.

Contributions are welcome for this project! To name a few TODO items, 3D texture
arrays are not yet implemented, texture mipmapping could be added, and examples
need to be added.
